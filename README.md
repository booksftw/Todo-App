# Todo List App

Developement Notes: Where I left off. This app is in good shape.
It's structured in a maintainable way and modularize. If you want to start up
again start in the presentation component. The presentation component creates a table but the new tasks for that table is null. I think the solution will probably
generating your UID to post to the db since firebase doesn't give auto id until
it's posted in the database.

You can also merge the styling so the tables are together and include drag features.
This app is almost done but the upgrading and polishing never ends, because i'm not selling this my work here is done.

My learning objectives are complete and i'm moving on to a new project that'll challenge me instead of polishing this
one up.
